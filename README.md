# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to help better understand demand for rideshare services, and improving access to these services.

## Results

### Number of rides by City Type

The data examined rideshare services in 3 types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. Urban cities demonstrated the largest demand for Pyber services, followed by suburban cities and then rural cities. Between January and May of 2019, urban cities had 1,625 rides, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities.

### Number of Drivers by City Type

Urban cities also had the most number of drivers (2,405), followed by suburban cities (490 drivers). Rural cities had the fewest number of drivers, totaling 78 drivers.

### Fares by City Type

Given these trends, it is not surprising that urban cities generate the most revenue. Conversely, the average fare per ride and average fare per rider are most expensive in rural cities, and least expensive for urban cities. Rural city riders pay about $10 more on average fare per ride. Rural drivers however earn about $55 per ride as compared to $17 per ride in urban cities and $40 in suburban cities.

### Weekly Snapshot January-April 2019

This trend is also supported by weekly data analyzed between January and April of 2019. Urban cities demonstrated the most usage as seen by Total Fares generated (gold line), followed by suburban cities (red line), and with rural cities trailing (blue line). One interesting finding was all three city types had similar peaks and valley time points in regards to rideshare usage through that time.

## Summary

The cost for using PyBer is greater among riders in rural cities than urban or suburban cities. This can discourage potential riders from using PyBer services. It is recommeded to pursue avenues to minimize this disparity to ensure more consistent and frequency of usage of PyBer services. Perhaps, looking further into other factors, such as need to travel further distances, that may be impacting rural city fares should be pursued. Another recommendation is to further analyze the peak and low trends to determine factors impacting usage of services. For example, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher in rural cities than suburban and urban cities. This can indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when there are peaks in business. Thirdly, drivers in rural areas earn more on average per ride as compared to their urban colleagues. This can persuade some drivers to move from urban cities to rural areas, thus impacting supply and demand in urban cities (which tends to have the highest demand for services).
